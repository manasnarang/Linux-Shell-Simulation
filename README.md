# Linux-Shell-Simulation
This is a simulation of a basic linux shell that can handle a limited set of internal and external commands.
This project was done as an Assignment under the Operating Systems course offered in Semester 3 at IIIT Delhi.

To run the shell, run the makefile using "make" command in the terminal. Then execute the file by writing ./simple_linux_shell in the terminal.

For more information regarding the commands implemented, please refer to OS_ASSIGNMENT_1_write_up.pdf file of this repository.
